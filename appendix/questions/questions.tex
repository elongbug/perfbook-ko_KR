\Epigraph{Ask me no questions, and I'll tell you no fibs.}
	 {\emph{``She Stoops to Conquer'', Oliver Goldsmith}}

The following sections discuss some important questions relating to
SMP programming.
Each section also shows how to avoid worrying about
the corresponding question, which can be extremely important if
your goal is to simply get your SMP code working as quickly and
painlessly as possible---which is an excellent goal, by the way!

Although the answers to these questions are often less
intuitive than they would be in a single-threaded setting,
with a bit of work, they are not that difficult to understand.
If you managed to master recursion, there is nothing here that should
pose an overwhelming challenge.

% @@@ doesn't parallel automatically make things faster? (locked increment)
% @@@ doesn't getting rid of locks get rid of all these problems? (atomic inc)
% @@@ doesn't NBS take care of all these problems? (cite IPDPS paper)
% @@@ why isn't more software correct?
