perfbook-ko_KR
==============

This is a git repository for Korean translation of Paul E. McKenney's book, "Is
Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It?".
In actual, this repository is just a fork of Paul E. Mckenney's git repository
for the original book source.
You can access the original book and its source from the address below:
- https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html

The translation is just for fun.
If things goes luckily, however, the translation may help Korean programmers to
understand the parallel programming well.
Also, the translation is official; The original author, Paul E. McKenney, also
references this repository:

Usage
=====

The source is in tex format; It is hard to read.
Just typing `make` from your linux commandline will give you the complete book
in PDF format.  However, the build requires few prerequisites. The
prerequisites may be complex to someone.  For the reason, the final PDF file
will be published to online of offline in future.  It's just a plan for now
because there is no money, no time to buy printer or host a server.  If you
need PDF version now and cannot get the build environment, try to send an
request email to translation author.
