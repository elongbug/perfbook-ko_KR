==============

This is a git repository for Korean translation of Paul Mckenny's book, "Is
Parallel Programming Hard, And, If So, What Can You Do About It?".
You can access the original book and its source from the address below:
- https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/paulmck/perfbook/perfbook.html

The translation is just for fun.
If things goes luckily, however, the translation may help Korean programmers to
understand the parallel programming well.
Also, the translation is official and Paul Mckenny, the original author, also
knows and announces it:
