\subsection{Counting Updates}
\label{sec:together:Counting Updates}

Schr\"odinger
(\cref{sec:datastruct:Motivating Application} 참고) 가 각 동물의 업데이트
횟수를 세고 싶어하며, 이 업데이트는 데이터 원소별 락을 이용해 동기화 된다고
해봅시다.
이 카운팅은 어떻게 해야 가장 잘 할 수 있을까요?

물론, \cref{chp:Counting} 에서의 카운팅 알고리즘들이 얼마든지 충분할 수도
있지만, 최적의 방법은 상당히 간단합니다.
각 데이터 원소에 카운터를 놓고, 그 원소의 락의 보호 아래 그 카운터를 증가시키는
겁니다!

읽기 쓰레드가 락 없이 이 숫자에 접근하면, 업데이트 쓰레드는 이 카운터를
업데이트 하는데에 \co{WRITE_ONCE()} 를 사용하고 락 없는 읽기 쓰레드는 이를 읽기
위해 \co{READ_ONCE()} 를 사용해야 합니다.

Suppose that Schr\"odinger (see
\cref{sec:datastruct:Motivating Application})
wants to count the number of updates for each animal,
and that these updates are synchronized using a per-data-element lock.
How can this counting best be done?

Of course, any number of counting algorithms from \cref{chp:Counting}
might qualify, but the optimal approach is quite simple.
Just place a counter in each data element, and increment it under the
protection of that element's lock!

If readers access the count locklessly, then updaters should use
\co{WRITE_ONCE()} to update the counter and lockless readers should
use \co{READ_ONCE()} to load it.

\subsection{Counting Lookups}
\label{sec:together:Counting Lookups}

Suppose that Schr\"odinger also wants to count the number of lookups for
each animal, where lookups are protected by RCU\@.
How can this counting best be done?

One approach would be to protect a lookup counter with the per-element
lock, as discussed in \cref{sec:together:Counting Updates}.
Unfortunately, this would require all lookups to acquire this lock,
which would be a severe bottleneck on large systems.

Another approach is to ``just say no'' to counting, following the example
of the \co{noatime} mount option.
If this approach is feasible, it is clearly the best:  After all, nothing
is faster than doing nothing.
If the lookup count cannot be dispensed with, read on!

Any of the counters from \cref{chp:Counting}
could be pressed into service, with the statistical counters described in
\cref{sec:count:Statistical Counters} being perhaps the most common choice.
However, this results in a large memory footprint: The number of counters
required is the number of data elements multiplied by the number of
threads.

If this memory overhead is excessive, then one approach is to keep
per-core or even per-socket counters rather than per-CPU counters,
with an eye to the hash-table performance results depicted in
\cref{fig:datastruct:Read-Only Hash-Table Performance For Schroedinger's Zoo; 448 CPUs}.
This will require that the counter increments be atomic operations,
especially for user-mode execution where a given thread could migrate
to another CPU at any time.

If some elements are looked up very frequently, there are a number
of approaches that batch updates by maintaining a per-thread log,
where multiple log entries for a given element can be merged.
After a given log entry has a sufficiently large increment or after
sufficient time has passed, the log entries may be applied to the
corresponding data elements.
Silas Boyd-Wickizer has done some work formalizing this
notion~\cite{SilasBoydWickizerPhD}.
