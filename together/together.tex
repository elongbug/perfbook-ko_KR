This chapter gives a few hints on handling some concurrent-programming
puzzles, starting with counter conundrums in
Section~\ref{sec:together:Counter Conundrums},
continuing with some RCU rescues in
Section~\ref{sec:together:RCU Rescues},
and finishing off with some hashing hassles in
Section~\ref{sec:together:Hashing Hassles}.

% Later add section on updates: hashed arrays of locks, fifos/streaming,
% batching to trade off latency for perf/scale.
