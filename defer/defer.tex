\QuickQuizChapter{chp:Deferred Processing}{Deferred Processing}

The strategy of deferring work goes back before the dawn of recorded
history. It has occasionally been derided as procrastination or
even as sheer laziness.
However, in the last few decades workers have recognized this strategy's value
in simplifying and streamlining parallel algorithms~\cite{Kung80,HMassalinPhD}.
Believe it or not, ``laziness'' in parallel programming often outperforms and
scales better than does industriousness!
These performance and scalability benefits stem from the fact that
deferring work often enables weakening of synchronization primitive,
thereby reducing synchronization overhead.
General approaches work deferral include
reference counting (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Reference Counting}),
sequence locking (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Sequence Locks}),
and RCU (Section~\ref{sec:defer:Read-Copy Update (RCU)}).
