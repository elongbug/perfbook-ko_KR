Author: David Howells 와 Paul McKenney.

인과성과 순서는 매우 직관적이고, 해커들은 이에 대해 일반적인 사람들보다 훨씬
깊은 이해를 갖고 있는 경향이 있습니다.
이 직관들은 순차적 코드이든 락킹과 RCU 같은 표준적 상호 배타 메커니즘을
사용하는 병렬 코드이든 코드를 작성하고 분석하고 디버깅하는데 매우 강력한 도구가
됩니다.

Author: David Howells and Paul McKenney.

Causality and sequencing are deeply intuitive, and hackers often
tend to have a much stronger grasp of these concepts than does
the general population.
These intuitions can be extremely powerful tools when writing, analyzing,
and debugging both sequential code and parallel code that makes
use of standard mutual-exclusion mechanisms, such as locking and
RCU.
\fi

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	Thread 1 & Thread 2 \\
	\hline
	\co{x = 1;} & \co{y = 1;} \\
	\co{r1 = y;} & \co{r2 = x;} \\
	\hline
	\multicolumn{2}{l}{\co{assert(r1 == 1 || r2 == 1);}} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Memory Misordering: Dekker}
\label{tab:advsync:Memory Misordering: Dekker}
\end{table}

불행히도, 이런 직관들은 공유메모리 안의 데이터 구조들을 위해 명시적 메모리
배리어를 직접 사용하는 코드에서는 완전히 어긋납니다.
예를 들어, Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory Misordering: Dekker} 의 리트머스
테스트는 해당 단정문이 결코 실패하지 않을 거라 보장되는 듯 보입니다.
일단, \co{r1 != 1} 이라면, 우린 쓰레드~1 의 \co{y} 로부터의 로드가 쓰레드~2 의
\co{y} 로의 스토어 이전에 일어났다고 볼 것이고, 따라서 쓰레드~2 의 \co{x}
로부터의 로드는 쓰레드~1 의 \co{x} 로의 스토어 이후에 일어났고, 따라서 해당
단정문에서 필요로 하는 \co{r2 == 1} 조건이 참일 것이라 생각될 수 있습니다.
예제는 대칭적이므로, 같은 원리로 \co{r2 != 1} 은 \co{r1 == 1} 을 보장한다고
생각하게 될 것입니다.
안타깝지만, Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory Misordering: Dekker} 의 메모리 배리어
부재로 인해 이런 생각은 깨져버립니다.
컴파일러도 CPU 도 쓰레드~1 과 쓰레드~2 의 문장들을 재배열 할 권리가 있으며,
이는 비교적 강한 순서 규칙을 제공하는 x86 같은 시스템에서도 마찬가지입니다.
\iffalse

Unfortunately, these intuitions break down completely in face of
code that makes direct use of explicit memory barriers for data structures
in shared memory.
For example, the litmus test in
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory Misordering: Dekker}
appears to guarantee that the assertion never fires.
After all, if \co{r1 != 1}, we might hope that Thread~1's load from \co{y}
must have happened before Thread~2's store to \co{y}, which might raise
further hopes that Thread~2's load from \co{x} must happen after
Thread~1's store to \co{x}, so that \co{r2 == 1}, as required by the
assertion.
The example is symmetric, so similar hopeful reasoning might lead
us to hope that \co{r2 != 1} guarantees that \co{r1 == 1}.
Unfortunately, the lack of memory barriers in
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory Misordering: Dekker}
dashes these hopes.
Both the compiler and the CPU are within their rights to reorder
the statements within both Thread~1 and Thread~2, even on relatively
strongly ordered systems such as x86.
\fi

다음의 섹션들을 통해 정확히 어디서 이 직관들이 깨지는지 알아보고, 이런 문제들을
방지하도록 도움을 줄 수 있는 메모리 배리어의 개념적 모델을 알아봅니다.

Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Memory Ordering and Memory Barriers} 는 메모리 접근
순서와 메모리 배리어에 대한 짧은 개론을 제공합니다.
일단 이 배경 지식을 알게 된다면, 다음은 당신의 직관에 문제가 있었음을 인정할
차례입니다.
이 고통스러운 일은
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:If B Follows A, and C Follows B, Why Doesn't C Follow A?}
에서 직관적으로는 올바른 것처럼 보이지만 실제 하드웨어에서는 비참하게 실패하고
마는 코드 조각들을 보이고
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Variables Can Have More Than One Value} 에서 여러
값들을 같은 시점에 가질 수 있는 스칼라 변수를 보이는 코드를 제공함으로써
처리합니다.
일단 이 슬픈 과정을 통해 직관을 똑바로 세운 후에는,
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:What Can You Trust?} 가 메모리 배리어가 따르는, 우리가
그 위에서부터 일을 시작해야 할 기본적 규칙을 제공합니다.
이런 규칙들은
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Review of Locking Implementations}
부터 Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Where Are Memory Barriers Needed?} 에서 좀 더
다듬어 집니다.
\iffalse

The following sections show exactly where this intuition breaks down,
and then puts forward a mental model of memory barriers that can help
you avoid these pitfalls.

Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Memory Ordering and Memory Barriers}
gives a brief overview of memory ordering and memory barriers.
Once this background is in place, the next step is to get you to admit
that your intuition has a problem.
This painful task is taken up by
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:If B Follows A, and C Follows B, Why Doesn't C Follow A?},
which shows an intuitively correct code fragment that fails miserably
on real hardware, and by
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Variables Can Have More Than One Value},
which presents some code demonstrating that scalar variables can
take on multiple values simultaneously.
Once your intuition has made it through the grieving process,
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:What Can You Trust?}
provides the basic rules that memory barriers follow, rules that we
will build upon.
These rules are further refined in
Sections~\ref{sec:advsync:Review of Locking Implementations}
through~\ref{sec:advsync:Where Are Memory Barriers Needed?}.

\subsection{Memory Ordering and Memory Barriers}
\label{sec:advsync:Memory Ordering and Memory Barriers}

그런데 왜 메모리 배리어들이 거기 있어야만 하는 걸까요?
CPU 들이 알아서 순서를 맞출 수 없나요?
그게 우리가 컴퓨터가 알아서 일을 하라고 최일선에 두는 이유 아닌가요?

많은 사람들이 실제로 컴퓨터들이 알아서 일을 할 거라고 예측합니다만, 또한 많은
사람들이 일을 빨리 해야 한다고 주장합니다.
근래의 컴퓨터 시스템 제조사들이 직면한 어려움 가운데 하나는 메인 메모리는 CPU
의 속도를 따라갈 수 없다는 것입니다 -- 근래의 CPU 들은 메모리에서 변수 하나를
가져오는데 필요한 시간동안 수백개의 인스트럭션들을 실행할 수 있습니다.
따라서 CPU 들은 Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Modern Computer System Cache Structure}
에 그려진 것처럼, 계속해서 거대한 캐시들을 사용합니다.
특정 CPU 에 의해 매우 자주 사용되는 변수들은 해당 CPU 의 캐시에 남아있는 경향을
보일 것이고, 이로 인해 해당 데이터에 대한 고속의 액세스가 가능해집니다.
\iffalse

But why are memory barriers needed in the first place?
Can't CPUs keep track of ordering on their own?
Isn't that why we have computers in the first place, to keep track of things?

Many people do indeed expect their computers to keep track of things,
but many also insist that they keep track of things quickly.
One difficulty that modern computer-system vendors face is that
the main memory cannot keep up with the CPU -- modern CPUs can execute
hundreds of instructions in the time required to fetch a single variable
from memory.
CPUs therefore sport increasingly large caches, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Modern Computer System Cache Structure}.
Variables that are heavily used by a given CPU will tend to remain
in that CPU's cache, allowing high-speed access to the corresponding
data.
\fi

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{appendix/whymb/cacheSC}}
\end{center}
\caption{Modern Computer System Cache Structure}
\label{fig:advsync:Modern Computer System Cache Structure}
\end{figure}

한 CPU 가 자신의 캐시에 아직 존재하지 않는 데이터에 접근하는 경우엔, 불행히도
데이터를 메모리로부터 가져와야 하는, 비싼 ``캐시 미스'' 를 초래하게 됩니다.
더 안타깝게도, 일반적인 코드의 수행은 상당한 캐시 미스를 초래합니다.
이로 인한 성능 하락을 제한하기 위해, CPU 들은 메모리 참조가 캐시 미스로 인해
메모리에서 데이터를 얻어오는 것을 기다리는 동안 다른 인스트럭션들을 실행할 수
있도록 설계되었습니다.
이는 분명히 인스트럭션들과 메모리 참조가 비순차적으로 실행되도록 해서
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:CPUs Can Do Things Out of Order} 에 보여지는 것과 같이
상당한 혼란을 가져올 수 있습니다.
컴파일러들과 (락킹과 RCU 같은) 동기화 도구들은 ``메모리 배리어들'' (예를 들어,
리눅스 커널의 \co{smp_mb()}) 을 이용해 순서가 맞춰지는 듯한 환상을 유지할
책임을 갖습니다.
이런 메모리 배리어들은 ARM, POWER, Itanium, 그리고 Alpha 에서와 같이 명시적인
인스트럭션들이 될 수도 있고, 또는 x86 에서처럼 다른 인스트럭션들에 의해
묵시적으로 실행될 수도 있습니다.
\iffalse

Unfortunately, when a CPU accesses data that is not yet in its cache
will result in an expensive ``cache miss'', requiring the data to
be fetched from main memory.
Doubly unfortunately, running typical code results in a significant
number of cache misses.
To limit the resulting performance degradation, CPUs have been designed to
execute other instructions and memory references while waiting for
a cache miss to fetch data from memory.
This clearly causes instructions and memory references to execute out
of order, which could cause serious confusion, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:CPUs Can Do Things Out of Order}.
Compilers and synchronization primitives (such as locking and RCU)
are responsible for maintaining the illusion of ordering through use of
``memory barriers'' (for example, \co{smp_mb()} in the Linux kernel).
These memory barriers can be explicit instructions, as they are on
ARM, POWER, Itanium, and Alpha, or they can be implied by other instructions,
as they are on x86.

표준 동기화 도구들은 순서의 환상을 지키므로, 이 섹션을 읽는 것을 멈추고 그냥 그
도구들을 사용하는 것이 좋을 것입니다.

하지만, 동기화 도구들 자체를 구현해야 한다면, 또는, 그저 메모리 접근 순서와
메모리 배리어들이 어떻게 동작하는지에 흥미가 있다면, 계속 읽으세요!

다음 섹션은 당신이 명시적으로 메모리 배리어를 사용한다면 마주할 수 있는, 직관에
반하는 시나리오들을 이야기 합니다.
\iffalse

Since the standard synchronization primitives preserve the illusion of
ordering, your path of least resistance is to stop reading
this section and simply use these primitives.

However, if you need to implement the synchronization primitives
themselves, or if you are simply interested in understanding how memory
ordering and memory barriers work, read on!

The next sections present counter-intuitive scenarios that you might
encounter when using explicit memory barriers.

\subsection{If B Follows A, and C Follows B, Why Doesn't C Follow A?}
\label{sec:advsync:If B Follows A, and C Follows B, Why Doesn't C Follow A?}

메모리 순서 규칙과 메모리 배리어는 매우 비직관적일 수 있습니다.
예를 들어, Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Parallel Hardware is Non-Causal} 의 함수들이
변수 A, B, C 가 초기값 0을 가진 채 병렬로 수행되는 경우를 생각해보세요:
\iffalse

Memory ordering and memory barriers can be extremely counter-intuitive.
For example, consider the functions shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Parallel Hardware is Non-Causal}
executing in parallel
where variables A, B, and C are initially zero:
\fi

\begin{figure}[htbp]
{ \centering
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  1 thread0(void)
  2 {
  3   A = 1;
  4   smp_wmb();
  5   B = 1;
  6 }
  7
  8 thread1(void)
  9 {
 10   while (B != 1)
 11     continue;
 12   barrier();
 13   C = 1;
 14 }
 15
 16 thread2(void)
 17 {
 18   while (C != 1)
 19     continue;
 20   barrier();
 21   assert(A != 0);
 22 }
\end{verbatim}
}
\caption{Parallel Hardware is Non-Causal}
\label{fig:advsync:Parallel Hardware is Non-Causal}
\end{figure}

직관적으로 볼 때, \co{thread0()} 는 B 의 값 할당을 A 에의 값 할당 후에 하고,
\co{thread1()} 은 C 에 값을 할당하기 전, \co{thread0()} 가 B 에 값을 할당할
때까지 기다리며, \co{thread2()} 는 A 의 값을 보기 전에 \co{thread1()} 이 C 에
값을 할당하기까지 기다립니다.
따라서, 역시 직관적으로, line~21 의 단정문은 실패할 수 없습니다.
\iffalse

Intuitively, \co{thread0()} assigns to B after it assigns to A,
\co{thread1()} waits until \co{thread0()} has assigned to B before
assigning to C, and \co{thread2()} waits until \co{thread1()} has
assigned to C before referencing A.
Therefore, again intuitively, the assertion on line~21 cannot possibly
fire.
\fi

이 말은, 직관적이기는 하지만, 완전히 잘못된 것입니다.
이건 이론적인 단정이 아님에 주의하시기 바랍니다: 실제로 이 코드를 현실의 약한
순서 규칙의 하드웨어 (1.5 GHz 16-CPU POWER 5 시스템) 에서 수행하면 천만번의
수행 중 16번 이 단정문이 실패했습니다.
분명, 명시적 메모리 배리어를 사용하는 코드를 작성하는 사람은 반드시 극단적인
테스트를 해야만 합니다 -- 정확성 증명이 도움이 될 수는 있지만, 메모리 배리어의
본질적으로 비직관적인 동작은 그런 증명이 기반하는 가정을 상당히 제약할 수
있습니다.
여러개의 하드웨어 의존적인 트릭들이 이 수행에서의 실패 가능성을 상당히
\emph{증가시키기} 때문에 극단적 테스트의 필요성은 결코 가벼워질 수 없습니다.
\iffalse

This line of reasoning, intuitively obvious though it may be, is completely
and utterly incorrect.
Please note that this is \emph{not} a theoretical assertion:
actually running this code on real-world weakly-ordered hardware
(a 1.5GHz 16-CPU POWER 5 system) resulted in the assertion firing
16 times out of 10 million runs.
Clearly, anyone who produces code with explicit memory barriers
should do some extreme testing -- although a proof of correctness might
be helpful, the strongly counter-intuitive nature of the behavior of
memory barriers should in turn strongly limit one's trust in such proofs.
The requirement for extreme testing should not be taken lightly, given
that a number of dirty hardware-dependent tricks were used to
greatly \emph{increase} the probability of failure in this run.

\QuickQuizAnswer{
	가장 쉬운 방법은 line~12 와 line~20 의 \co{barrier()} 를 \co{smp_mb()}

	The easiest fix is to replace each of the \co{barrier()}s on
	line~12 and line~20 with an \co{smp_mb()}.

	Of course, some hardware is more forgiving than other hardware.
	For example, on x86 the assertion on line~21 of
	Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Parallel Hardware is Non-Causal} on
	page~\pageref{fig:advsync:Parallel Hardware is Non-Causal}
	cannot trigger.
	On PowerPC, only the \co{barrier()} on line~20 need be
	replaced with \co{smp_mb()} to prevent the assertion from
	triggering.
	\fi
} \QuickQuizEnd

그러니 이제 어떡해야 할까요?
최선의 선택지는, 가능하다면 모든 필요한 메모리 배리어를 내포하고 있는 현존하는
기능들을 사용하고 이 챕터의 나머지 내용을 그냥 무시하는 것입니다.

물론, 동기화 도구를 직접 구현하고 있다면 그럴 수는 없습니다.
다음의 메모리 순서 규칙과 메모리 배리어에 대한 이야기는 그런 경우를 위한
것입니다.
\iffalse

So what should you do?
Your best strategy, if possible, is to use existing primitives that
incorporate any needed memory barriers, so that you can simply ignore
the rest of this chapter.

Of course, if you are implementing synchronization primitives,
you don't have this luxury.
The following discussion of memory ordering and memory barriers
is for you.

\subsection{Variables Can Have More Than One Value}
\label{sec:advsync:Variables Can Have More Than One Value}

변수가 잘 정의된 글로벌한 순서로 값의 시퀀스를 갖는다고 생각하는건 자연스러운
일입니다.
하지만, 지금은 안타깝더라도 이런 안락한 상상에 작별을 고해야 할 때입니다.

이를 알기 위해, Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Software Logic Analyzer} 의 코드 조각을
보기 바랍니다.
이 코드 조각은 여러 CPU 들에 의해 병렬로 실행됩니다.
Line~1 은 공유된 변수 하나를 자신의 CPU 의 ID 로 값을 넣고, line~2 에서는
몇개의 변수들을 모든 CPU 들에 동기화 되는, 세밀한 하드웨어 ``timebase``
카운터를 얻어오는 (안타깝지만, 모든 CPU 아키텍쳐에서 가능한 일은 아닙니다!)
\co{gettb()} 함수로 얻어온 값으로 초기화 하며, line~3-8 의 루프에서는 이 CPU 가
변수에 할당한 값을 통해 자신이 루프 내에서 사용한 시간의 길이를 기록합니다.
물론, CPU 들 가운데 하나만 루프에 남는데 ``승리하고'', 따라서 line~6-8 의
체크에 걸리기 전까지는지 루프를 빠져나가지 않을 것입니다.
\iffalse

It is natural to think of a variable as taking on a well-defined
sequence of values in a well-defined, global order.
Unfortunately, it is time to say ``goodbye'' to this sort of comforting
fiction.

To see this, consider the program fragment shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Software Logic Analyzer}.
This code fragment is executed in parallel by several CPUs.
Line~1 sets a shared variable to the current CPU's ID, line~2
initializes several variables from a \co{gettb()} function that
delivers the value of a fine-grained hardware ``timebase'' counter that is
synchronized among all CPUs (not available from all CPU architectures,
unfortunately!), and the loop from lines~3-8 records the length of
time that the variable retains the value that this CPU assigned to it.
Of course, one of the CPUs will ``win'', and would thus never exit
the loop if not for the check on lines~6-8.

루프의 종료 전까지, \co{firsttb} 는 최초 할당된 값인 타임스탬프를 가지고 있게
되고 \co{lasttb} 는 이번 타임스탬프 샘플링 이전 샘플링에서 얻어져 할당되었고
여전히 변수에 담겨 있는 타임스탬프를, 또는, 해당 변수가 루프 진입 전에 바뀐 값
그대로라면, \co{firsttb} 와 동일한 값을 가지고 있을 겁니다.
이는 Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:A Variable With Multiple Simultaneous Values} 에
그려진 것처럼 532 나노세컨드의 시간동안 각 CPU 가 \co{state.variable} 을 보는
시각을 그려볼 수 있게 합니다.
이 데이터는 각자 2개의 하드웨어 쓰레드를 갖는 8개의 코어를 갖는 1.5 GHz POWER5
시스템 에서 얻어졌습니다.
CPU~1, 2, 3, 4 는 CPU~0 가 테스트를 제어하는 동안 값을 기록했습니다.
타임스탬프 카운터가 값을 증가시키는 시간은 약 5.32 ns 이었으므로, 중간의 캐시
상태를 관찰하는데 충분히 세밀했습니다.
\iffalse

Upon exit from the loop, \co{firsttb} will hold a timestamp
taken shortly after the assignment and \co{lasttb} will hold
a timestamp taken before the last sampling of the shared variable
that still retained the assigned value, or a value equal to \co{firsttb}
if the shared variable had changed before entry into the loop.
This allows us to plot each CPU's view of the value of \co{state.variable}
over a 532-nanosecond time period, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:A Variable With Multiple Simultaneous Values}.
This data was collected on 1.5GHz POWER5 system with 8 cores, each containing
a pair of hardware threads.
CPUs~1, 2, 3, and 4 recorded the values, while CPU~0 controlled the test.
The timebase counter period was about 5.32ns, sufficiently fine-grained
to allow observations of intermediate cache states.

각각의 수평선은 각 CPU 의 관찰 결과를 시간에 따라 나타내는데, 왼쪽의 검정색
영역은 해당 CPU 의 첫번째 관측 전의 시간을 나타냅니다.
첫 5ns 동안, CPU~3 만이 해당 변수에 대해 의견을 제시합니다.
다음 10ns 동안, CPU~2 와 3 이 해당 변수의 값에 동의하지 않지만, 곧이어 해당
값은 ``2'' 라고 동의하게 되며, 이것이 최종 동의된 값입니다.
하지만, CPU~1 은 이 값이 ``1'' 이라고 거의 300ns 동안 믿으며, CPU~4 는 거의
500ns 동안이나 해당 값이 ``4'' 라고 믿습니다.
\iffalse

Each horizontal bar represents the observations of a given CPU over time,
with the black regions to the left indicating the time before the
corresponding CPU's first measurement.
During the first 5ns, only CPU~3 has an opinion about the value of the
variable.
During the next 10ns, CPUs~2 and 3 disagree on the value of the variable,
but thereafter agree that the value is ``2'', which is in fact
the final agreed-upon value.
However, CPU~1 believes that the value is ``1'' for almost 300ns, and
CPU~4 believes that the value is ``4'' for almost 500ns.

	CPU~2 와 3 은 같은 코어에서 수행되는 하드웨어 쓰레드여서 같은 캐시

	CPUs~2 and 3 are a pair of hardware threads on the same
	core, sharing the same cache hierarchy, and therefore have
	very low communications latencies.
	This is a NUMA, or, more accurately, a NUCA effect.

	This leads to the question of why CPUs~2 and 3 ever disagree
	at all.
	One possible reason is that they each might have a small amount
	of private cache in addition to a larger shared cache.

이제 메모리 배리어가 필요해지는 체제입니다.

We have entered a regime where we must bid a fond farewell to
comfortable intuitions about values of variables and the passage of time.
This is the regime where memory barriers are needed.

\subsection{What Can You Trust?}
\label{sec:advsync:What Can You Trust?}

당신은 결코 당신의 직관을 믿어선 안됩니다.

You most definitely cannot trust your intuition.

당신이 메모리 배리어를 잘 사용할 수 있게 해주는 몇개의 적당히 간단한 규칙들이
있다는 게 밝혀졌습니다.
이 섹션에서는 적어도 이식성 있는 코드의 관점에서 메모리 배리어 이야기의 바닥에
도달해 보고자 하는 사람들을 위해 그런 규칙들을 유도해 봅니다.
실제 유도를 고생스럽게 해보기보다는 그냥 그 규칙들을 간단히 보고 싶다면, 부담
갖지 말고 Section~\ref{sec:advsync:A Few Simple Rules} 로 건너뛰어도 좋습니다.

메모리 배리어의 실제 개념은 CPU 에 따라 상당히 다르기 때문에 호환성 있는 코드는
메모리 배리어 개념들 중 최소한의 공통 분모들에만 의존성을 가져야 합니다.
\iffalse

It turns out that there are a few reasonably simple rules that
allow you to make good use of memory barriers.
This section derives those rules, for those who wish to get
to the bottom of the memory-barrier story, at least from the viewpoint
of portable code.
If you just want to be told what the rules are rather than suffering
through the actual derivation,
please feel free to skip to Section~\ref{sec:advsync:A Few Simple Rules}.

The exact semantics of memory barriers vary wildly from one CPU to
another, so portable code must rely only on the least-common-denominator
semantics of memory barriers.
\fi

다행히도, 모든 CPU 들이 다음의 규칙들을 갖습니다:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	한 CPU 에 의한 모든 액세스들은 그 CPU 에는 프로그램 순서대로 일어나는
	것으로 보인다.
\item	모든 CPU 들의 하나의 변수로의 액세스들은 그 변수로의 스토어
	오퍼레이션들의 어떤 글로벌 순서 규칙에 맞춰 일관성을 갖는다.
\item	메모리 배리어들은 짝을 맞춰 동작한다.
\item	오퍼레이션들은 배타적 락킹 도구들이 구현되는 곳에 사용될 수 있다.
\end{enumerate}
\iffalse

Fortunately, all CPUs impose the following rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	All accesses by a given CPU will appear to that CPU to have
	occurred in program order.
\item	All CPUs' accesses to a single variable will be consistent with
	some global ordering of stores to that variable.
\item	Memory barriers will operate in a pair-wise fashion.
\item	Operations will be provided from which exclusive locking
	primitives may be constructed.
\end{enumerate}
\fi

따라서, 당신이 이식 가능한 코드에서 메모리 배리어를 사용해야 한다면, 이런
특성들에 의존할 수 있습니다.\footnote{
	또는, 아예 명시적인 메모리 배리어의 사용을 하지 않는게 나을 수도
	있습니다.
	하지만 그 방법은 다른 섹션의 주제가 될것입니다.}
이런 특성들 각각은 다음의 섹션들에서 설명됩니다.
\iffalse

Therefore, if you need to use memory barriers in portable code,
you can rely on all of these properties.\footnote{
	Or, better yet, you can avoid explicit use of memory barriers
	entirely.
	But that would be the subject of other sections.}
Each of these properties is described in the following sections.
\fi

\subsubsection{Self-References Are Ordered}

하나의 CPU 는 자신의 메모리 액세스들을 마치 인스트럭션들을 재배치나 예측성 수행
없이 한번에 하나의 인스트럭션만을 순차적으로 실행하듯이, ``프로그램 순서'' 대로
일어나는 것처럼 보게 됩니다.
오래된 CPU 들의 경우, 이 제약은 바이너리 호환성을 위해 필요하며, 우리의 타입의
소프트웨어들의 정상성은 부차적인 이유일 뿐입니다.
이 규칙을 제한된 범위 내에서나마 위반한 CPU 들도 일부 있었습니다만, 그런
경우에도 컴파일러에게 순서 규칙이 명시적으로 지켜질 수 있도록 해야 할 의무가
지워져 있었습니다.

어떤 쪽이건, 프로그래머의 관점에서 CPU 는 자신의 액세스들은 프로그램 순서대로
보게 됩니다.
\iffalse

A given CPU will see its own accesses as occurring in ``program order'',
as if the CPU was executing only one instruction at a time with no
reordering or speculation.
For older CPUs, this restriction is necessary for binary compatibility,
and only secondarily for the sanity of us software types.
There have been a few CPUs that violate this rule to a limited extent,
but in those cases, the compiler has been responsible
for ensuring that ordering is explicitly enforced as needed.

Either way, from the programmer's viewpoint, the CPU sees its own accesses
in program order.
\fi

\subsubsection{Single-Variable Memory Consistency}
\label{sec:advsync:Single-Variable Memory Consistency}

현재의 상용 컴퓨터 시스템들은 \emph{캐시 일관성} 을 제공하기 때문에, 어떤 CPU
무리가 모두 하나의 변수에 동시에 어토믹하지 않은 스토어를 하게 되면, 모든 CPU
들에 보이는 일련의 값들은 적어도 하나의 글로벌 순서 규칙에 의해 일관적일
것입니다.
예를 들어,
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:A Variable With Multiple Simultaneous Values} 에 보이는
일련의 액세스들에서,
CPU~1 는 {\tt \{1,2\}} 순서로,
CPU~2 는 {\tt \{2\}} 순서로,
CPU~3 는 {\tt \{3,2\}} 순서로,
그리고
CPU~4 는 {\tt \{4,2\}} 순서로 그 값을 보게 됩니다.
이는 글로벌한 순서 {\tt \{3,1,4,2\}} 로 일관성을 갖습니다만, 꼭 이 순서가
아니라도 이 네개의 숫자를 가지고 ``2'' 로 끝나는, 다른 다섯개의 순서로 글로벌
순서를 유추하는 것도 가능합니다.
즉, 하나의 변수에서 얻어지는 값의 순서에는 모호함이 있긴 하나, 모든 CPU 의
합의가 이뤄집니다.
\iffalse

Because current commercially available computer systems provide
\emph{cache coherence},
if a group of CPUs all do concurrent non-atomic stores to a single variable,
the series of values seen by all CPUs will be consistent with at
least one global ordering.
For example, in the series of accesses shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:A Variable With Multiple Simultaneous Values},
CPU~1 sees the sequence {\tt \{1,2\}},
CPU~2 sees the sequence {\tt \{2\}},
CPU~3 sees the sequence {\tt \{3,2\}},
and
CPU~4 sees the sequence {\tt \{4,2\}}.
This is consistent with the global sequence {\tt \{3,1,4,2\}},
but also with all five of the other sequences of these four numbers that end
in ``2''.
Thus, there will be agreement on the sequence of values taken on
by a single variable, but there might be ambiguity.
\fi

반면에, 이 CPU 들이 간단한 유일값의 스토어가 아니라 (리눅스 커널의
\co{atomic_inc_return()} 과 같은) 어토믹 오퍼레이션들을 사용했다면, CPU 들이
보게 되는 결과들은 하나의 전체적으로 일관된 순서의 값들이 될 것입니다.
\co{atomic_inc_return()} 실행 중 하나가 먼저 일어나서 그 값을 0 에서 1 로
바꾸고, 다음엔 두번째가 1 에서 2로, 그리고 그렇게 진행됩니다.
이 CPU 들은 각자 본 것들을 비교하고 \co{atomic_inc_return()} 실행의 분명한
순서에의 합의를 얻을 수 있을 것입니다.
이는 앞서 설명한 어토믹하지 않은 스토어로는 불가능한 일인데, 어토믹하지 않은
스토어는 모호성의 가능성으로 인해 이전의 값에 대한 정보를 알려주지 않기
때문입니다.
\iffalse

In contrast, had the CPUs used atomic operations (such as the Linux kernel's
\co{atomic_inc_return()} primitive) rather than simple stores of
unique values, their observations would
be guaranteed to determine a single globally consistent sequence of values.
One of the \co{atomic_inc_return()} invocations would happen first,
and would change the value from 0 to 1, the second from 1 to 2, and
so on.
The CPUs could compare notes afterwards and come to agreement on the
exact ordering of the sequence of \co{atomic_inc_return()} invocations.
This does not work for the non-atomic stores described earlier because
the non-atomic stores do not return any indication of the earlier value,
hence the possibility of ambiguity.
\fi

이 섹션은 모든 CPU 들이 하나의 변수에 접근할 때에\emph{만} 적용됨에
주의하십시오.
이 단일 변수의 경우, 과감한 컴파일러 최적화가 리눅스 커널의 \co{ACCESS_ONCE()}
지시어나 C++11 의 완화된 어토믹 오퍼레이션들~\cite{PeteBecker2011N3242}를 통해
방지되었다는 최소한의 가정 위에서는 캐시 일관성이 글로벌한 순서를 보장합니다.
반면, 만약 여러 변수들이 있다면, 현재의 상용 컴퓨터 시스템들에서는 CPU 들이
일관성 있게 순서에 합의할 수 있도록 하기 위해 메모리 배리어가 필요합니다.
\iffalse

Please note well that this section applies \emph{only} when all
CPUs' accesses are to one single variable.
In this single-variable case, cache coherence guarantees the
global ordering, at least assuming that some of the more aggressive
compiler optimizations are disabled via the Linux kernel's
\co{ACCESS_ONCE()} directive or C++11's relaxed
atomics~\cite{PeteBecker2011N3242}.
In contrast, if there are multiple variables, memory barriers are
required for the CPUs to consistently agree on the order for current
commercially available computer systems.
\fi

\subsubsection{Pair-Wise Memory Barriers}

Pair-wise memory barriers provide conditional ordering semantics.
For example, in the following set of operations, CPU~1's access to
A does not unconditionally precede its access to B from the viewpoint
of an external logic analyzer
\IfInBook{(see Appendix~\ref{chp:app:whymb:Why Memory Barriers?}
	  for examples).
	 }
	 {(the system is only to act \emph{as if} the accesses
	  are in order; it is not necessarily required to actually
	  force them to be in order).}
However, if CPU~2's access to B sees the result of CPU~1's access
to B, then CPU~2's access to A is guaranteed to see the result of
CPU~1's access to A.
Although some CPUs' memory barriers do in fact provide stronger,
unconditional ordering guarantees, portable code may rely only
on this weaker if-then conditional ordering guarantee.

	\co{access(B);} &	\co{access(A);} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

\QuickQuiz{}
	But if the memory barriers do not unconditionally force
	ordering, how the heck can a device driver reliably execute
	sequences of loads and stores to MMIO registers?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	MMIO registers are special cases: because they appear
	in uncached regions of physical memory.
	Memory barriers \emph{do} unconditionally force ordering
	of loads and stores to uncached memory, as discussed in
	Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Device Operations}.
} \QuickQuizEnd

Of course, accesses must be either loads or stores, and these
do have different properties.
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory-Barrier Combinations}
shows all possible combinations of loads and stores from a pair
of CPUs.
Of course, to enforce conditional ordering, there must be
a memory barrier between each CPU's pair of operations.

\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Pair-Wise Memory Barriers: Portable Combinations}

The following pairings from
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory-Barrier Combinations},
enumerate all the combinations of memory-barrier
pairings that portable software may depend on.

\paragraph{Pairing 1.}
	In this pairing, one CPU executes a pair of loads separated
	by a memory barrier, while a second CPU executes a pair
	of stores also separated by a memory barrier, as follows
	(both A and B are initially equal to zero):
	\vspace{5pt}
	\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
	\tt
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		CPU 1 &			CPU 2 \\
		\hline
		\co{A=1;} &		\co{Y=B;} \\
		\co{smp_mb();} &	\co{smp_mb();} \\
		\co{B=1;} &		\co{X=A;} \\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{minipage}
	\vspace{5pt}
	After both CPUs have completed executing these code sequences,
	if \co{Y==1}, then we must also have \co{X==1}.
	In this case, the fact that \co{Y==1} means that
	CPU~2's load prior to its memory barrier has
	seen the store following CPU~1's memory barrier.
	Due to the pairwise nature of memory barriers, CPU~2's
	load following its memory barrier must therefore see
	the store that precedes CPU~1's memory barrier, so that
	\co{X==1}.

	On the other hand, if \co{Y==0}, the memory-barrier condition
	does not hold, and so in this case, X could be either 0 or 1.

\paragraph{Pairing 2.}
	In this pairing, each CPU executes a load followed by a
	memory barrier followed by a store, as follows
	(both A and B are initially equal to zero):
	\vspace{5pt}
	\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
	\tt
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		CPU 1 &			CPU 2 \\
		\hline
		\co{X=A;} &		\co{Y=B;} \\
		\co{smp_mb();} &	\co{smp_mb();} \\
		\co{B=1;} &		\co{A=1;} \\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{minipage}
	\vspace{5pt}
	After both CPUs have completed executing these code sequences,
	if \co{X==1}, then we must also have \co{Y==0}.
	In this case, the fact that \co{X==1} means that
	CPU~1's load prior to its memory barrier has
	seen the store following CPU~2's memory barrier.
	Due to the pairwise nature of memory barriers, CPU~1's
	store following its memory barrier must therefore see
	the results of CPU~2's load preceding its memory barrier,
	so that \co{Y==0}.

	On the other hand, if \co{X==0}, the memory-barrier condition
	does not hold, and so in this case, Y could be either 0 or 1.

	The two CPUs' code sequences are symmetric, so if \co{Y==1}
	after both CPUs have finished executing these code sequences,
	then we must have \co{X==0}.

\paragraph{Pairing 3.}
	In this pairing, one CPU executes a load followed by a
	memory barrier followed by a store, while the other CPU
	executes a pair of stores separated by a memory barrier,
	as follows (both A and B are initially equal to zero):
	\vspace{5pt}
	\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
	\tt
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		CPU 1 &			CPU 2 \\
		\hline
		\co{X=A;} &		\co{B=2;} \\
		\co{smp_mb();} &	\co{smp_mb();} \\
		\co{B=1;} &		\co{A=1;} \\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{minipage}
	\vspace{5pt}
	After both CPUs have completed executing these code sequences,
	if \co{X==1}, then we must also have \co{B==1}.
	In this case, the fact that \co{X==1} means that
	CPU~1's load prior to its memory barrier has
	seen the store following CPU~2's memory barrier.
	Due to the pairwise nature of memory barriers, CPU~1's
	store following its memory barrier must therefore see
	the results of CPU~2's store preceding its memory barrier.
	This means that CPU~1's store to B will overwrite CPU~2's
	store to B, resulting in \co{B==1}.

	On the other hand, if \co{X==0}, the memory-barrier condition
	does not hold, and so in this case, B could be either 1 or 2.

\subsubsection{Pair-Wise Memory Barriers: Semi-Portable Combinations}

The following pairings from
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory-Barrier Combinations}
can be used on modern hardware, but might fail on some systems
that were produced in the 1900s.
However, these \emph{can} safely be used on all mainstream hardware
introduced since the year 2000.
So if you think that memory barriers are difficult to deal with, please
keep in mind that they used to be a \emph{lot} harder on some systems!

\paragraph{Ears to Mouths.}
	Since the stores cannot see the results of the loads
	(again, ignoring MMIO registers for the moment),
	it is not always possible to determine whether the memory-barrier
	condition has been met.
	However, 21\textsuperscript{st}-century
	hardware \emph{would} guarantee that at least one
	of the loads saw the value stored by the corresponding store
	(or some later value for that same variable).

\QuickQuiz{}
	How do we know that modern hardware guarantees that at least
	one of the loads will see the value stored by the other thread
	in the ears-to-mouths scenario?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	The scenario is as follows, with A and B both initially zero:

	CPU~0: A=1; \co{smp_mb()}; r1=B;

	CPU~1: B=1; \co{smp_mb()}; r2=A;

	If neither of the loads see the corresponding store, when both
	CPUs finish, both \co{r1} and \co{r2} will be equal to zero.
	Let's suppose that \co{r1} is equal to zero.
	Then we know that CPU~0's load from B happened before CPU~1's
	store to B: After all, we would have had \co{r1} equal to one
	otherwise.
	But given that CPU~0's load from B happened before CPU~1's store
	to B, memory-barrier pairing guarantees that CPU~0's store to A
	happens before CPU~1's load from A, which in turn guarantees that
	\co{r2} will be equal to one, not zero.

	Therefore, at least one of \co{r1} and \co{r2} must be nonzero,
	which means that at least one of the loads saw the value from
	the corresponding store, as claimed.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\paragraph{Stores ``Pass in the Night''.}
	In the following example, after both CPUs have finished
	executing their code sequences, it is quite tempting to
	conclude that the result {\tt \{A==1,B==2\}} cannot happen.

	\vspace{5pt}
	\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
	\tt
	\begin{tabular}{l|l}
		CPU 1 &			CPU 2 \\
		\hline
		\co{A=1;} &		\co{B=2;} \\
		\co{smp_mb();} &	\co{smp_mb();} \\
		\co{B=1;} &		\co{A=2;} \\
	\end{tabular}
	\end{minipage}
	\vspace{5pt}

	Unfortunately, although this conclusion is correct on
	21\textsuperscript{st}-century systems, it does not necessarily hold
	on all antique 20\textsuperscript{th}-century systems.
	Suppose that the cache line containing A is initially owned
	by CPU~2, and that containing B is initially owned by CPU~1.
	Then, in systems that have invalidation queues and store
	buffers, it is possible for the first assignments to ``pass
	in the night'', so that the second assignments actually
	happen first.
	\IfInBook{This strange effect is explained in
	          Appendix~\ref{chp:app:whymb:Why Memory Barriers?}.
		 }
		 {}

	This same effect can happen in any memory-barrier pairing
	where each CPU's memory barrier is preceded by a store,
	including the ``ears to mouths'' pairing.

	However, 21\textsuperscript{st}-century hardware \emph{does}
	accommodate these ordering intuitions, and \emph{do} permit
	this combination to be used safely.

\subsubsection{Pair-Wise Memory Barriers: Dubious Combinations}

In the following combinations from
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory-Barrier Combinations},
the memory barriers have very limited use in portable code, even
on 21\textsuperscript{st}-century hardware.
However, ``limited use'' is different than ``no use'', so let's see
what can be done!
Avid readers will want to write toy programs that rely on each of
these combinations in order to fully understand how this works.

\paragraph{Ears to Ears.}
	Since loads do not change the state of memory
	(ignoring MMIO registers for the moment),
	it is not possible for one of the loads to see the
	results of the other load.
	However, if we know that CPU~2's load from B returned a
	newer value than CPU~1's load from B, the we also know
	that CPU~2's load from A returned either the same value
	as CPU~1's load from A or some later value.

\paragraph{Mouth to Mouth, Ear to Ear.}
	One of the variables is only loaded from, and the other
	is only stored to.
	Because (once again, ignoring MMIO registers) it is not
	possible for one load to see the results of the other,
	it is not possible to detect the conditional ordering
	provided by the memory barrier.

	However, it is possible to determine which store happened
	last, but this requires an additional load from B.
	If this additional load from B is executed after both
	CPUs~1 and~2 complete, and if it turns out that CPU~2's
	store to B happened last, then we know
	that CPU~2's load from A returned either the same value
	as CPU~1's load from A or some later value.

\paragraph{Only One Store.}
	Because there is only one store, only one of the variables
	permits one CPU to see the results of the other CPU's
	access.
	Therefore, there is no way to detect the
	conditional ordering provided by the memory barriers.

	At least not straightforwardly.
	But suppose that in combination~1 from
	Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory-Barrier Combinations},
	CPU~1's load from A returns the value that CPU~2 stored
	to A.  Then we know that CPU~1's load from B returned
	either the same value as CPU~2's load from A or some later value.

\QuickQuiz{}
	How can the other ``Only one store'' entries in
	Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Memory-Barrier Combinations}
	be used?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	For combination~2, if CPU~1's load from B sees a value prior
	to CPU~2's store to B, then we know that CPU~2's load from A
	will return the same value as CPU~1's load from A, or some later
	value.

	For combination~4, if CPU~2's load from B sees the value from
	CPU~1's store to B, then we know that CPU~2's load from A
	will return the same value as CPU~1's load from A, or some later
	value.

	For combination~8, if CPU~2's load from A sees CPU~1's store
	to A, then we know that CPU~1's load from B will return the same
	value as CPU~2's load from A, or some later value.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\subsubsection{Semantics Sufficient to Implement Locking}

Suppose we have an exclusive lock (\co{spinlock_t} in the Linux
kernel, \co{pthread_mutex_t} in pthreads code) that guards a number
of variables (in other words, these variables are not accessed except
from the lock's critical sections).
The following properties must then hold true:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	A given CPU or thread must see all of its own loads and stores
	as if they had occurred in program order.
\item	The lock acquisitions and releases must appear to have executed
	in a single global order.\footnote{
		Of course, this order might be different from one run
		to the next.
		On any given run, however, all CPUs and threads must
		have a consistent view of the order of critical sections
		for a given exclusive lock.}
\item	Suppose a given variable has not yet been stored in a
	critical section that is currently executing.
	Then any load from a given variable performed in that critical section
	must see the last store to that variable from the last previous
	critical section that stored to it.
\end{enumerate}

The difference between the last two properties is a bit subtle:
the second requires that the lock acquisitions and releases occur
in a well-defined order, while the third requires that the critical
sections not ``bleed out'' far enough to cause difficulties for
other critical section.

Why are these properties necessary?

Suppose the first property did not hold.
Then the assertion in the following code might well fail!

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
a = 1;
b = 1 + a;
assert(b == 2);
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\label{codesample:advsync:What Can You Count On? 1}
\vspace{5pt}

\QuickQuiz{}
	How could the assertion {\tt b==2} on
	page~\pageref{codesample:advsync:What Can You Count On? 1}
	possibly fail?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	If the CPU is not required to see all of its loads and
	stores in order, then the {\tt b=1+a} might well see an
	old version of the variable ``a''.

	This is why it is so very important that each CPU or thread
	see all of its own loads and stores in program order.
} \QuickQuizEnd

Suppose that the second property did not hold.
Then the following code might leak memory!

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
spin_lock(&mylock);
if (p == NULL)
  p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), GFP_KERNEL);
spin_unlock(&mylock);
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\label{codesample:advsync:What Can You Count On? 2}
\vspace{5pt}

\QuickQuiz{}
	How could the code on
	page~\pageref{codesample:advsync:What Can You Count On? 2}
	possibly leak memory?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Only the first execution of the critical section should
	see {\tt p==NULL}.
	However, if there is no global ordering of critical sections for
	{\tt mylock}, then how can you say that a particular one was
	first?
	If several different executions of that critical section thought
	that they were first, they would all see {\tt p==NULL}, and
	they would all allocate memory.
	All but one of those allocations would be leaked.

	This is why it is so very important that all the critical sections
	for a given exclusive lock appear to execute in some well-defined
	order.
} \QuickQuizEnd

Suppose that the third property did not hold.
Then the counter shown in the following code might well count backwards.
This third property is crucial, as it cannot be strictly true with
pairwise memory barriers.

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
spin_lock(&mylock);
ctr = ctr + 1;
spin_unlock(&mylock);
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\label{codesample:advsync:What Can You Count On? 3}
\vspace{5pt}

\QuickQuiz{}
	How could the code on
	page~\pageref{codesample:advsync:What Can You Count On? 2}
	possibly count backwards?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Suppose that the counter started out with the value zero,
	and that three executions of the critical section had therefore
	brought its value to three.
	If the fourth execution of the critical section is not constrained
	to see the most recent store to this variable, it might well see
	the original value of zero, and therefore set the counter to
	one, which would be going backwards.

	This is why it is so very important that loads from a given variable
	in a given critical
	section see the last store from the last prior critical section to
	store to that variable.
} \QuickQuizEnd

If you are convinced that these rules are necessary, let's look at how
they interact with a typical locking implementation.

\subsection{Review of Locking Implementations}
\label{sec:advsync:Review of Locking Implementations}

Naive pseudocode for simple lock and unlock operations are shown below.
Note that the \co{atomic_xchg()} primitive implies a memory barrier
both before and after the atomic exchange operation, and that the
implicit barrier after the atomic exchange operation eliminates
the need for an explicit memory barrier in \co{spin_lock()}.
Note also that, despite the names, \co{atomic_read()} and
\co{atomic_set()} do \emph{not}
execute any atomic instructions, instead, it merely executes a
simple load and store, respectively.
This pseudocode follows a number of Linux implementations for
the unlock operation, which is a simple non-atomic store following a
memory barrier.
These minimal implementations must possess all the locking properties
laid out in Section~\ref{sec:advsync:What Can You Trust?}.

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  1 void spin_lock(spinlock_t *lck)
  2 {
  3   while (atomic_xchg(&lck->a, 1) != 0)
  4     while (atomic_read(&lck->a) != 0)
  5       continue;
  6 }
  7 
  8 void spin_unlock(spinlock_t lck)
  9 {
 10   smp_mb();
 11   atomic_set(&lck->a, 0);
 12 }
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\label{codesample:advsync:Naive Lock and Unlock Pseudocode}
\vspace{5pt}

The \co{spin_lock()} primitive cannot proceed until
the preceding \co{spin_unlock()} primitive completes.
If CPU~1 is releasing a lock that CPU~2 is attempting to acquire,
the sequence of operations might be as follows:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt \scriptsize
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	CPU 1 &			CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	(critical section) &	\co{atomic_xchg(&lck->a, 1)->1} \\
	\co{smp_mb();} &	\co{lck->a->1} \\
	\co{lck->a=0;} &	\co{lck->a->1} \\
	&			\co{lck->a->0} \\
	&			(implicit \co{smp_mb()} 1) \\
	&			\co{atomic_xchg(&lck->a, 1)->0} \\
	&			(implicit \co{smp_mb()} 2) \\
	&			(critical section) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

In this particular case, pairwise memory barriers suffice to keep
the two critical sections in place.
CPU~2's \co{atomic_xchg(&lck->a, 1)} has seen CPU~1's \co{lck->a=0},
so therefore everything in CPU~2's following critical section must see
everything that CPU~1's preceding critical section did.
Conversely, CPU~1's critical section cannot see anything that CPU~2's
critical section will do.

\subsection{A Few Simple Rules}
\label{sec:advsync:A Few Simple Rules}

Probably the easiest way to understand memory barriers is to understand
a few simple rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Each CPU sees its own accesses in order.
\item	If a single shared variable is loaded and stored by multiple
	CPUs, then the series of values seen by a given CPU will be
	consistent with the series seen by the other CPUs, and there
	will be at least one sequence consisting of all values stored
	to that variable with which each CPUs series will be
	consistent.\footnote{
		A given CPU's series may of course be incomplete,
		for example, if a given CPU never loaded or stored
		the shared variable, then it can have no opinion about
		that variable's value.}
\item	If one CPU does ordered stores to variables A and B,\footnote{
		For example, by executing the store to A, a
		memory barrier, and then the store to B.},
	and if a second CPU does ordered loads from B and A,\footnote{
		For example, by executing the load from B, a
		memory barrier, and then the load from A.},
	then if the second CPU's load from B gives the value stored
	by the first CPU, then the second CPU's load from A must
	give the value stored by the first CPU.
\item	If one CPU does a load from A ordered before a store to B,
	and if a second CPU does a load from B ordered before a store from A,
	and if the second CPU's load from B gives the value stored by
	the first CPU, then the first CPU's load from A must \emph{not}
	give the value stored by the second CPU.
\item	If one CPU does a load from A ordered before a store to B,
	and if a second CPU does a store to B ordered before a
	store to A, and if the first CPU's load from A gives
	the value stored by the second CPU, then the first CPU's
	store to B must happen after the second CPU's store to B,
	hence the value stored by the first CPU persists.\footnote{
		Or, for the more competitively oriented, the first
		CPU's store to B ``wins''.}
\end{enumerate}

The next section takes a more operational view of these rules.

\subsection{Abstract Memory Access Model}

Consider the abstract model of the system shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Abstract Memory Access Model}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/AbstractMemoryAccessModel}
\end{center}
\caption{Abstract Memory Access Model}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Abstract Memory Access Model}{David Howells}
\end{figure}

Each CPU executes a program that generates memory access operations.  In the
abstract CPU, memory operation ordering is very relaxed, and a CPU may actually
perform the memory operations in any order it likes, provided program causality
appears to be maintained.  Similarly, the compiler may also arrange the
instructions it emits in any order it likes, provided it doesn't affect the
apparent operation of the program.

So in the above diagram, the effects of the memory operations performed by a
CPU are perceived by the rest of the system as the operations cross the
interface between the CPU and rest of the system (the dotted lines).


For example, consider the following sequence of events given the
initial values {\tt \{A = 1, B = 2\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 3; &	x = A; \\
	B = 4; &	y = B; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

The set of accesses as seen by the memory system in the middle can be arranged
in 24 different combinations, with loads denoted by ``ld'' and stores
denoted by ``st'':

~ \\
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{llll}
	st A=3, & st B=4, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$4 \\
	st A=3, & st B=4, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$4, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3 \\
	st A=3, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3, & st B=4, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$4 \\
	st A=3, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$2, & st B=4 \\
	st A=3, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$2, & st B=4, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3 \\
	st A=3, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$2, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3, & st B=4 \\
	st B=4, & st A=3, & x=ld A$\rightarrow$3, & y=ld B$\rightarrow$4 \\
	st B=4, & ... & & \\
	... & & & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

and can thus result in four different combinations of values:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{ll}
	x == 1, & y == 2 \\
	x == 1, & y == 4 \\
	x == 3, & y == 2 \\
	x == 3, & y == 4 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Furthermore, the stores committed by a CPU to the memory system may not be
perceived by the loads made by another CPU in the same order as the stores were
committed.

As a further example, consider this sequence of events given the
initial values {\tt \{A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, P = \&A, Q = \&C\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	B = 4; &	Q = P; \\
	P = \&B &	D = *Q; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

There is an obvious data dependency here,
as the value loaded into \co{D} depends on
the address retrieved from \co{P} by CPU~2.
At the end of the sequence, any of the
following results are possible:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{c@{ and }c}
	(Q == \&A) & (D == 1) \\
	(Q == \&B) & (D == 2) \\
	(Q == \&B) & (D == 4) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Note that CPU~2 will never try and load C into D because the CPU will load P
into Q before issuing the load of *Q.

\subsection{Device Operations}
\label{sec:advsync:Device Operations}

Some devices present their control interfaces as collections of memory
locations, but the order in which the control registers are accessed is very
important.  For instance, imagine an Ethernet card with a set of internal
registers that are accessed through an address port register (A) and a data
port register (D).  To read internal register 5, the following code might then
be used:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
*A = 5;
x = *D;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

but this might show up as either of the following two sequences:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
STORE *A = 5, x = LOAD *D
x = LOAD *D, STORE *A = 5
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

the second of which will almost certainly result in a malfunction, since it set
the address \emph{after} attempting to read the register.

\subsection{Guarantees}
\label{sec:advsync:Guarantees}

There are some minimal guarantees that may be expected of a CPU:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	On any given CPU, dependent memory accesses will be issued in order,
	with respect to itself.  This means that for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
Q = P; D = *Q;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	the CPU will issue the following memory operations:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
Q = LOAD P, D = LOAD *Q
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	and always in that order.

\item	Overlapping loads and stores within a particular CPU will appear to be
	ordered within that CPU.  This means that for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
a = *X; *X = b;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	the CPU will only issue the following sequence of memory operations:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
a = LOAD *X, STORE *X = b
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	And for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
*X = c; d = *X;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	the CPU will only issue:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
STORE *X = c, d = LOAD *X
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	(Loads and stores overlap if they are targeted at overlapping pieces of
	memory).
\item	A series of stores to a single variable will appear to all
	CPUs to have occurred in a single order, though this order
	might not be predictable from the code, and in fact the
	order might vary from one run to another.
\end{enumerate}

And there are a number of things that \emph{must} or \emph{must not} be assumed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	It \emph{must not} be assumed that independent loads and stores will
	be issued in the order given.  This means that for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
X = *A; Y = *B; *D = Z;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	we may get any of the following sequences:


\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
X = LOAD *A,   Y = LOAD *B,  STORE *D = Z
X = LOAD *A,   STORE *D = Z, Y = LOAD *B
Y = LOAD *B,   X = LOAD *A,  STORE *D = Z
Y = LOAD *B,   STORE *D = Z, X = LOAD *A
STORE *D = Z,  X = LOAD *A,  Y = LOAD *B
STORE *D = Z,  Y = LOAD *B,  X = LOAD *A
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

\item	It \emph{must} be assumed that overlapping memory accesses may
	be merged or discarded.  This means that for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
X = *A; Y = *(A + 4);
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	we may get any one of the following sequences:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
X = LOAD *A; Y = LOAD *(A + 4);
Y = LOAD *(A + 4); X = LOAD *A;
{X, Y} = LOAD {*A, *(A + 4) };
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	And for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
*A = X; Y = *A;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	we may get any of:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
STORE *A = X; STORE *(A + 4) = Y;
STORE *(A + 4) = Y; STORE *A = X;
STORE {*A, *(A + 4) } = {X, Y};
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	Finally, for:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
*A = X; *A = Y;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

	we may get either of:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
STORE *A = X; STORE *A = Y;
STORE *A = Y;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{What Are Memory Barriers?}
\label{sec:advsync:What Are Memory Barriers?}

As can be seen above, independent memory operations are effectively performed
in random order, but this can be a problem for CPU-CPU interaction and for I/O.
What is required is some way of intervening to instruct the compiler and the
CPU to restrict the order.

Memory barriers are such interventions.  They impose a perceived partial
ordering over the memory operations on either side of the barrier.

Such enforcement is important because the CPUs and other devices in a system
can use a variety of tricks to improve performance - including reordering,
deferral and combination of memory operations; speculative loads; speculative
branch prediction and various types of caching.  Memory barriers are used to
override or suppress these tricks, allowing the code to sanely control the
interaction of multiple CPUs and/or devices.

\subsubsection{Explicit Memory Barriers}
\label{sec:advsync:Explicit Memory Barriers}

Memory barriers come in four basic varieties:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Write (or store) memory barriers,
\item	Data dependency barriers,
\item	Read (or load) memory barriers, and
\item	General memory barriers.
\end{enumerate}

Each variety is described below.

\paragraph{Write Memory Barriers}

A write memory barrier gives a guarantee that all the STORE operations
specified before the barrier will appear to happen before all the STORE
operations specified after the barrier with respect to the other
components of the system.

A write barrier is a partial ordering on stores only; it is not required
to have any effect on loads.

A CPU can be viewed as committing a sequence of store operations to the
memory system as time progresses.  All stores before a write barrier will
occur in the sequence \emph{before} all the stores after the write barrier.

$\dagger$ Note that write barriers should normally be paired with read
or data dependency barriers; see the ``SMP barrier pairing'' subsection.

\paragraph{Data Dependency Barriers}

A data dependency barrier is a weaker form of read barrier.  In the case
where two loads are performed such that the second depends on the result
of the first (e.g., the first load retrieves the address to which the second
load will be directed), a data dependency barrier would be required to
make sure that the target of the second load is updated before the address
obtained by the first load is accessed.

A data dependency barrier is a partial ordering on interdependent loads
only; it is not required to have any effect on stores, independent loads
or overlapping loads.

As mentioned for write memory barriers,
the other CPUs in the system can be viewed as
committing sequences of stores to the memory system that the CPU being
considered can then perceive.  A data dependency barrier issued by the CPU
under consideration guarantees that for any load preceding it, if that
load touches one of a sequence of stores from another CPU, then by the
time the barrier completes, the effects of all the stores prior to that
touched by the load will be perceptible to any loads issued after the data
dependency barrier.

See the ``Examples of memory barrier sequences'' subsection for diagrams
showing the ordering constraints.

$\dagger$ Note that the first load really has to have a
\emph{data} dependency and
not a control dependency.  If the address for the second load is dependent
on the first load, but the dependency is through a conditional rather than
actually loading the address itself, then it's a \emph{control} dependency and
a full read barrier or better is required.  See the ``Control dependencies''
subsection for more information.

$\dagger$ Note that data dependency barriers should normally be paired with
write barriers; see the ``SMP barrier pairing'' subsection.

\paragraph{Read Memory Barriers}

A read barrier is a data dependency barrier plus a guarantee that all the
LOAD operations specified before the barrier will appear to happen before
all the LOAD operations specified after the barrier with respect to the
other components of the system.

A read barrier is a partial ordering on loads only; it is not required to
have any effect on stores.

Read memory barriers imply data dependency barriers, and so can substitute
for them.

$\dagger$ Note that read barriers should normally be paired with write barriers;
see the ``SMP barrier pairing'' subsection.

\paragraph{General Memory Barriers}

A general memory barrier gives a guarantee that all the LOAD and STORE
operations specified before the barrier will appear to happen before all
the LOAD and STORE operations specified after the barrier with respect to
the other components of the system.

A general memory barrier is a partial ordering over both loads and stores.

General memory barriers imply both read and write memory barriers, and so
can substitute for either.

\subsubsection{Implicit Memory Barriers}

There are a couple of types of implicit memory barriers, so called
because they are embedded into locking primitives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	LOCK operations and
\item	UNLOCK operations.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{LOCK Operations}

A lock operation acts as a one-way permeable barrier.
It guarantees that all memory
operations after the LOCK operation will appear to happen after the LOCK
operation with respect to the other components of the system.

Memory operations that occur before a LOCK operation may appear to happen
after it completes.

A LOCK operation should almost always be paired with an UNLOCK operation.

\paragraph{UNLOCK Operations}

Unlock operations also act as a one-way permeable barrier.
It guarantees that all
memory operations before the UNLOCK operation will appear to happen before
the UNLOCK operation with respect to the other components of the system.

Memory operations that occur after an UNLOCK operation may appear to
happen before it completes.

LOCK and UNLOCK operations are guaranteed to appear with respect to each
other strictly in the order specified.

The use of LOCK and UNLOCK operations generally precludes the need for
other sorts of memory barrier (but note the exceptions mentioned in the
subsection ``MMIO write barrier'').

\QuickQuiz{}
	What effect does the following sequence have on the
	order of stores to variables ``a'' and ``b''? \\
	{\tt ~~~~a = 1;} \\
	{\tt ~~~~b = 1;} \\
	{\tt ~~~~<write barrier>}
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Absolutely none.  This barrier {\em would} ensure that the
	assignments to ``a'' and ``b'' happened before any subsequent
	assignments, but it does nothing to enforce any order of
	assignments to ``a'' and ``b'' themselves.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\subsubsection{What May Not Be Assumed About Memory Barriers?}
\label{sec:advsync:What May Not Be Assumed About Memory Barriers?}

There are certain things that memory barriers cannot guarantee outside
of the confines of a given architecture:

\begin{enumerate}
\item	There is no guarantee that any of the memory accesses specified
	before a memory barrier will be \emph{complete} by the completion
	of a memory barrier instruction; the barrier can be considered
	to draw a line in that CPU's access queue that accesses of the
	appropriate type may not cross.
\item	There is no guarantee that issuing a memory barrier on one CPU
	will have any direct effect on another CPU or any other hardware
	in the system.	The indirect effect will be the order in which
	the second CPU sees the effects of the first CPU's accesses occur,
	but see the next point.
\item	There is no guarantee that a CPU will see the correct order
	of effects from a second CPU's accesses, even \emph{if} the second CPU
	uses a memory barrier, unless the first CPU \emph{also} uses a matching
	memory barrier (see the subsection on ``SMP Barrier Pairing'').
\item	There is no guarantee that some intervening piece of off-the-CPU
	hardware\footnote{
		This is of concern primarily in operating-system kernels.
		For more information on hardware operations and memory
		ordering, see the files \url{pci.txt}, \url{DMA-API-HOWTO.txt},
		and \url{DMA-API.txt} in the \url{Documentation} directory in
		the Linux source tree~\cite{Torvalds2.6kernel}.}
	will not reorder the memory accesses.  CPU cache
	coherency mechanisms should propagate the indirect effects of
	a memory barrier between CPUs, but might not do so in order.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Data Dependency Barriers}
\label{sec:advsync:Data Dependency Barriers}

The usage requirements of data dependency barriers are a little subtle, and
it's not always obvious that they're needed.  To illustrate, consider the
following sequence of events, with initial values
{\tt \{A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, P = \&A, Q = \&C\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	B = 4; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	P = \&B; &	\\
		&	Q = P; \\
		&	D = *Q; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

There's a clear data dependency here, and it would seem intuitively
obvious that by the end of the sequence, \co{Q} must be either \co{&A}
or \co{&B}, and that:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{c@{ implies }c}
	(Q == \&A) & (D == 1) \\
	(Q == \&B) & (D == 4) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Counter-intuitive though it might be, it is quite possible that
CPU~2's perception of \co{P} might be updated \emph{before} its perception
of \co{B}, thus leading to the following situation:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{c@{ and }c}
	(Q == \&B) & (D == 2) ???? \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Whilst this may seem like a failure of coherency or causality maintenance, it
isn't, and this behaviour can be observed on certain real CPUs (such as the DEC
Alpha).

To deal with this, a data dependency barrier must be inserted between the
address load and the data load (again with initial values of
{\tt \{A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, P = \&A, Q = \&C\}}):

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	B = 4; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	P = \&B; &	\\
		&	Q = P; \\
		&	<data dependency barrier> \\
		&	D = *Q; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

This enforces the occurrence of one of the two implications, and prevents the
third possibility from arising.

Note that this extremely counterintuitive situation arises most easily on
machines with split caches, so that, for example, one cache bank processes
even-numbered cache lines and the other bank processes odd-numbered cache
lines.
The pointer \co{P} might be stored in an odd-numbered cache line, and the
variable \co{B} might be stored in an even-numbered cache line.  Then, if the
even-numbered bank of the reading CPU's cache is extremely busy while the
odd-numbered bank is idle, one can see the new value of the
pointer \co{P} (which is \co{&B}),
but the old value of the variable \co{B} (which is 2).

Another example of where data dependency barriers might by required is where a
number is read from memory and then used to calculate the index for an array
access with initial values
{\tt \{M[0] = 1, M[1] = 2, M[3] = 3, P = 0, Q = 3\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	M[1] = 4; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	P = 1;	&	\\
		&	Q = P; \\
		&	<data dependency barrier> \\
		&	D = M[Q]; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

The data dependency barrier is very important to the Linux kernel's
RCU system, for example,
see \co{rcu_dereference()} in \url{include/linux/rcupdate.h}.
This permits the current
target of an RCU'd pointer to be replaced with a new modified target, without
the replacement target appearing to be incompletely initialised.

See also
Section~\ref{sec:advsync:Cache Coherency}
for a larger example.

\subsubsection{Control Dependencies}
\label{sec:advsync:Control Dependencies}

A control dependency requires a full read memory barrier, not simply a data
dependency barrier to make it work correctly.  Consider the following bit of
code:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  1 q = &a;
  2 if (p)
  3   q = &b;
  4 <data dependency barrier>
  5 x = *q;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

This will not have the desired effect because there is no actual data
dependency, but rather a control dependency that the CPU may short-circuit by
attempting to predict the outcome in advance.  In such a case what's actually
required is:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  1 q = &a;
  2 if (p)
  3   q = &b;
  4 <read barrier>
  5 x = *q;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

\subsubsection{SMP Barrier Pairing}
\label{sec:advsync:SMP Barrier Pairing}

When dealing with CPU-CPU interactions, certain types of memory barrier should
always be paired.  A lack of appropriate pairing is almost certainly an error.

A write barrier should always be paired with a data dependency barrier or read
barrier, though a general barrier would also be viable.  Similarly a read
barrier or a data dependency barrier should always be paired with at least a
write barrier, though, again, a general barrier is viable:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	B = 2;	&	\\
		&	X = B; \\
		&	<read barrier> \\
		&	Y = A; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Or:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	B = \&A; &	\\
		&	X = B; \\
		&	<data dependency barrier> \\
		&	Y = *X; \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

One way or another, the read barrier must always be present, even though
it might be of a weaker type.\footnote{
	By ``weaker'', we mean ``makes fewer ordering guarantees''.
	A weaker barrier is usually also lower-overhead than is a
	stronger barrier.}

Note that the stores before the write barrier would normally be expected to
match the loads after the read barrier or data dependency barrier, and vice
versa:

\begin{center}
\resizebox{3in}{!}{\includegraphics{advsync/MemoryBarrierPairing}}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Examples of Memory Barrier Pairings}
\label{sec:advsync:Examples of Memory Barrier Pairings}

Firstly, write barriers act as partial orderings on store operations.
Consider the following sequence of events:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l}
	STORE A = 1 \\
	STORE B = 2 \\
	STORE C = 3 \\
	<write barrier> \\
	STORE D = 4 \\
	STORE E = 5 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

This sequence of events is committed to the memory coherence system in an order
that the rest of the system might perceive as the unordered set of
{\tt \{A=1,B=2,C=3\}}
all occurring before the unordered set of
{\tt \{D=4,E=5\}}, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Write Barrier Ordering Semantics}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/WriteBarrierOrdering}
\end{center}
\caption{Write Barrier Ordering Semantics}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Write Barrier Ordering Semantics}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

Secondly, data dependency barriers act as partial orderings on data-dependent
loads.  Consider the following sequence of events with initial values
{\tt \{B = 7, X = 9, Y = 8, C = \&Y\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	B = 2; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	C = \&B; & 	LOAD X\\
	D = 4;	&	LOAD C (gets \&B) \\
		&	LOAD *C (reads B) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Without intervention, CPU~2 may perceive the events on CPU~1 in some
effectively random order, despite the write barrier issued by CPU~1, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Data Dependency Barrier Omitted}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/DataDependencyNeeded}
\end{center}
\caption{Data Dependency Barrier Omitted}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Data Dependency Barrier Omitted}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

In the above example, CPU~2 perceives that \co{B} is 7,
despite the load of \co{*C}
(which would be \co{B}) coming after the \co{LOAD} of \co{C}.

If, however, a data dependency barrier were to be placed between the load of C
and the load of \co{*C} (i.e.: \co{B}) on CPU~2, again with initial values of
{\tt \{B = 7, X = 9, Y = 8, C = \&Y\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	B = 2; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	C = \&B; & 	LOAD X\\
	D = 4;	&	LOAD C (gets \&B) \\
		&	<data dependency barrier> \\
		&	LOAD *C (reads B) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

then ordering will be as intuitively expected, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Data Dependency Barrier Supplied}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/DataDependencySupplied}
\end{center}
\caption{Data Dependency Barrier Supplied}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Data Dependency Barrier Supplied}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

And thirdly, a read barrier acts as a partial order on loads.  Consider the
following sequence of events, with initial values
{\tt \{A = 0, B = 9\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	B = 2; & \\
		&	LOAD B \\
		&	LOAD A \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Without intervention, CPU~2 may then choose to perceive the events on CPU~1 in
some effectively random order, despite the write barrier issued by CPU~1, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Needed}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/ReadBarrierNeeded}
\end{center}
\caption{Read Barrier Needed}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Needed}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

If, however, a read barrier were to be placed between the load of \co{B}
and the load of \co{A} on CPU~2, again with initial values of
{\tt \{A = 0, B = 9\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	B = 2; & \\
		&	LOAD B \\
		&	<read barrier> \\
		&	LOAD A \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

then the partial ordering imposed by CPU~1's write barrier will be
perceived correctly by CPU~2, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Supplied}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/ReadBarrierSupplied}
\end{center}
\caption{Read Barrier Supplied}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Supplied}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

To illustrate this more completely, consider what could happen if the code
contained a load of A either side of the read barrier, once again
with the same initial values of
{\tt \{A = 0, B = 9\}}:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
	A = 1; & \\
	<write barrier> & \\
	B = 2; & \\
		&	LOAD B \\
		&	LOAD A (1\textsuperscript{st}) \\
		&	<read barrier> \\
		&	LOAD A (2\textsuperscript{nd}) \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Even though the two loads of \co{A}
both occur after the load of \co{B}, they may both
come up with different values, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Supplied, Double Load}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/ReadBarrierSupplied1}
\end{center}
\caption{Read Barrier Supplied, Double Load}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Supplied, Double Load}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

Of course, it may well be that CPU~1's update to \co{A} becomes perceptible
to CPU~2 before the read barrier completes, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Supplied, Take Two}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/ReadBarrierSupplied2}
\end{center}
\caption{Read Barrier Supplied, Take Two}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Read Barrier Supplied, Take Two}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

The guarantee is that the second load will always come up with \co{A == 1}
if the
load of \co{B} came up with \co{B == 2}.
No such guarantee exists for the first load of
\co{A}; that may come up with either \co{A == 0} or \co{A == 1}.

\subsubsection{Read Memory Barriers vs. Load Speculation}
\label{sec:advsync:Read Memory Barriers vs. Load Speculation}

Many CPUs speculate with loads: that is, they see that they will need to
load an item from memory, and they find a time where they're not using
the bus for any other loads, and then do the load in advance --- even though
they haven't actually got to that point in the instruction execution
flow yet.
Later on, this potentially permits the actual load instruction to
complete immediately because the CPU already has the value on hand.

It may turn out that the CPU didn't actually need the value (perhaps because a
branch circumvented the load) in which case it can discard the value or just
cache it for later use.
For example, consider the following:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
		&	LOAD B \\
		&	DIVIDE \\
		&	DIVIDE \\
		&	LOAD A \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

On some CPUs, divide instructions can take a long time to complete,
which means that CPU~2's bus might go idle during that time.
CPU~2 might therefore speculatively load \co{A} before the divides
complete.
In the (hopefully) unlikely event of an exception from one of the dividees,
this speculative load will have been wasted, but in the (again, hopefully)
common case, overlapping the load with the divides will permit the load
to complete more quickly, as illustrated by
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Speculative Load}.

\begin{figure*}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{advsync/SpeculativeLoad}
\end{center}
\caption{Speculative Load}
\ContributedBy{Figure}{fig:advsync:Speculative Load}{David Howells}
\end{figure*}

Placing a read barrier or a data dependency barrier just before the second
load:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\tt
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.5in}}
	CPU 1 &		CPU 2 \\
	\hline
		&	LOAD B \\
		&	DIVIDE \\
		&	DIVIDE \\
		&	<read barrier> \\
		&	LOAD A \\
\end{tabular}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

will force any value speculatively obtained to be reconsidered to an extent
dependent on the type of barrier used.  If there was no change made to the
speculated memory location, then the speculated value will just be used,
as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Speculative Loads and Barrier}.
On the other hand, if there was an update or invalidation to \co{A}
from some other CPU, then the speculation will be cancelled and the
value of \co{A} will be reloaded,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Speculative Loads Cancelled by Barrier}.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Locking Constraints}
\label{sec:advsync:Locking Constraints}

As noted earlier, locking primitives contain implicit memory barriers.
These implicit memory barriers provide the following guarantees:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	LOCK operation guarantee:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	Memory operations issued after the LOCK will be completed
		after the LOCK operation has completed.
	\item	Memory operations issued before the LOCK may be completed
		after the LOCK operation has completed.
	\end{itemize}
\item	UNLOCK operation guarantee:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	Memory operations issued before the UNLOCK will be
		completed before the UNLOCK operation has completed.
	\item	Memory operations issued after the UNLOCK may be completed
		before the UNLOCK operation has completed.
	\end{itemize}
\item	LOCK vs LOCK guarantee:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	All LOCK operations issued before another LOCK operation
		will be completed before that LOCK operation.
	\end{itemize}
\item	LOCK vs UNLOCK guarantee:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	All LOCK operations issued before an UNLOCK operation
		will be completed before the UNLOCK operation.
	\item	All UNLOCK operations issued before a LOCK operation
		will be completed before the LOCK operation.
	\end{itemize}
\item	Failed conditional LOCK guarantee:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item	Certain variants of the LOCK operation may fail, either
		due to being unable to get the lock immediately, or due
		to receiving an unblocked signal or exception
		whilst asleep waiting
		for the lock to become available.  Failed locks do not
		imply any sort of barrier.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Memory-Barrier Examples}
\label{sec:advsync:Memory-Barrier Examples}

\subsubsection{Locking Examples}

\paragraph{LOCK Followed by UNLOCK:}
A LOCK followed by an UNLOCK may not be assumed to be a full memory barrier
because it is possible for an access preceding the LOCK to happen after the
LOCK, and an access following the UNLOCK to happen before the UNLOCK, and the
two accesses can themselves then cross.
For example, the following:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  1 *A = a;
  2 LOCK
  3 UNLOCK
  4 *B = b;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

might well execute in the following order:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  2 LOCK
  4 *B = b;
  1 *A = a;
  3 UNLOCK
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

Again, always remember that both LOCK and UNLOCK are permitted to let
preceding operations ``bleed in'' to the critical section.

\QuickQuiz{}
	What sequence of LOCK-UNLOCK operations \emph{would}
	act as a full memory barrier?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	A series of two back-to-back LOCK-UNLOCK operations, or, somewhat
	less conventionally, an UNLOCK operation followed by a LOCK
	operation.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\QuickQuiz{}
	What (if any) CPUs have memory-barrier instructions
	from which these semi-permeable locking primitives might
	be constructed?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	Itanium is one example.
	The identification of any others is left as an
	exercise for the reader.
} \QuickQuizEnd

\paragraph{LOCK-Based Critical Sections:}
Although a LOCK-UNLOCK pair does not act as a full memory barrier,
these operations \emph{do} affect memory ordering.

Consider the following code:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  1 *A = a;
  2 *B = b;
  3 LOCK
  4 *C = c;
  5 *D = d;
  6 UNLOCK
  7 *E = e;
  8 *F = f;
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

This could legitimately execute in the following order, where pairs
of operations on the same line indicate that the CPU executed those
operations concurrently:

\vspace{5pt}
\begin{minipage}[t]{\columnwidth}
\scriptsize
\begin{verbatim}
  3 LOCK
  1 *A = a; *F = f;
  7 *E = e;
  4 *C = c; *D = d;
  2 *B = b;
  6 UNLOCK
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\vspace{5pt}

\begin{table}[htbp]
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
  \# & Ordering: legitimate or not? \\
  \hline
  \hline
  1 & \co{*A; *B; LOCK; *C; *D; UNLOCK; *E; *F;} \\
  \hline
  2 & \tt{*A; \{*B; LOCK;\} *C; *D; UNLOCK; *E; *F;} \\
  \hline
  3 & \tt{\{*F; *A;\} *B; LOCK; *C; *D; UNLOCK; *E;} \\
  \hline
  4 & \tt{*A; *B; \{LOCK; *C;\} *D; \{UNLOCK; *E;\} *F;} \\
  \hline
  5 & \co{*B; LOCK; *C; *D; *A; UNLOCK; *E; *F;} \\
  \hline
  6 & \co{*A; *B; *C; LOCK; *D; UNLOCK; *E; *F;} \\
  \hline
  7 & \co{*A; *B; LOCK; *C; UNLOCK; *D; *E; *F;} \\
  \hline
  8 & \tt{\{*B; *A; LOCK;\} \{*D; *C;\} \{UNLOCK; *F; *E;\}} \\
  \hline
  9 & \tt{*B; LOCK; *C; *D; UNLOCK; \{*F; *A;\} *E; } \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Lock-Based Critical Sections}
\label{tab:advsync:Lock-Based Critical Sections}
\end{table}

\QuickQuiz{}
	Given that operations grouped in curly braces are executed
	concurrently, which of the rows of
	Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Lock-Based Critical Sections}
	are legitimate reorderings of the assignments to variables
	``A'' through ``F'' and the LOCK/UNLOCK operations?
	(The order in the code is A, B, LOCK, C, D, UNLOCK, E, F.)
	Why or why not?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	Legitimate, executed in order.
	\item	Legitimate, the lock acquisition was executed concurrently
		with the last assignment preceding the critical section.
	\item	Illegitimate, the assignment to ``F'' must follow the LOCK
		operation.
	\item	Illegitimate, the LOCK must complete before any operation in
		the critical section.  However, the UNLOCK may legitimately
		be executed concurrently with subsequent operations.
	\item	Legitimate, the assignment to ``A'' precedes the UNLOCK,
		as required, and all other operations are in order.
	\item	Illegitimate, the assignment to ``C'' must follow the LOCK.
	\item	Illegitimate, the assignment to ``D'' must precede the UNLOCK.
	\item	Legitimate, all assignments are ordered with respect to the
		LOCK and UNLOCK operations.
	\item	Illegitimate, the assignment to ``A'' must precede the UNLOCK.
	\end{enumerate}
} \QuickQuizEnd

\paragraph{Ordering with Multiple Locks:}
Code containing multiple locks still sees ordering constraints from
those locks, but one must be careful to keep track of which lock is which.
For example, consider the code shown in
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Ordering With Multiple Locks}, which uses
a pair of locks named ``M'' and ``Q''.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
  \co{CPU 1}     & \co{CPU 2} \\
  \hline
  \co{A = a;}    & \co{E = e;} \\
  \co{LOCK M;}   & \co{LOCK Q;} \\
  \co{B = b;}    & \co{F = f;} \\
  \co{C = c;}    & \co{G = g;} \\
  \co{UNLOCK M;} & \co{UNLOCK Q;} \\
  \co{D = d;}    & \co{H = h;} \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Ordering With Multiple Locks}
\label{tab:advsync:Ordering With Multiple Locks}
\end{table}

In this example, there are no guarantees as to what order the
assignments to variables ``A'' through ``H'' will appear in, other
than the constraints imposed by the locks themselves, as
described in the previous section.

\QuickQuiz{}
	What are the constraints for
	Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Ordering With Multiple Locks}?
\QuickQuizAnswer{
	All CPUs must see the following ordering constraints:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item	LOCK M precedes B, C, and D.
	\item	UNLOCK M follows A, B, and C.
	\item	LOCK Q precedes F, G, and H.
	\item	UNLOCK Q follows E, F, and G.
	\end{enumerate}
} \QuickQuizEnd

\paragraph{Ordering with Multiple CPUs on One Lock:}
Suppose, instead of the two different locks as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Ordering With Multiple Locks}, both CPUs acquire
the same lock, as shown in
Table~\ref{tab:advsync:Ordering With Multiple CPUs on One Lock}?

\begin{table}[htbp]
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
  \co{CPU 1}     & \co{CPU 2} \\
  \hline
  \co{A = a;}    & \co{E = e;} \\
  \co{LOCK M;}   & \co{LOCK M;} \\
  \co{B = b;}    & \co{F = f;} \\
  \co{C = c;}    & \co{G = g;} \\
  \co{UNLOCK M;} & \co{UNLOCK M;} \\
  \co{D = d;}    & \co{H = h;} \\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Ordering With Multiple CPUs on One Lock}
\label{tab:advsync:Ordering With Multiple CPUs on One Lock}
\end{table}

In this case, either CPU~1 acquires M before CPU~2 does, or vice versa.
In the first case, the assignments to A, B, and C must precede
those to F, G, and H.
On the other hand, if CPU~2 acquires the lock first, then the
assignments to E, F, and G must precede those to B, C, and D.

\subsection{The Effects of the CPU Cache}
\label{sec:advsync:The Effects of the CPU Cache}

The perceived ordering of memory operations is affected by the caches
that lie between the CPUs and memory, as well as by the cache coherence
protocol that maintains memory consistency and ordering.
From a software viewpoint, these caches are for all intents and purposes
part of memory.
Memory barriers can be thought of as acting on the vertical dotted line in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Memory Architecture}, ensuring that the CPU
presents its values to memory in the proper order, as well as ensuring
that it sees changes made by other CPUs in the proper order.

\end{figure*}

Although the caches can ``hide'' a given CPU's memory accesses from the rest of
the system, the cache-coherence protocol ensures that all other CPUs see
any effects of these hidden accesses, migrating and invalidating cachelines
as required.
Furthermore, the CPU core may execute instructions in any order, restricted
only by the requirement that program causality and memory ordering
appear to be maintained.
Some of these instructions may generate memory accesses that must be queued
in the CPU's memory access queue, but execution may nonetheless continue
until the CPU either fills up its internal resources or until it must
wait for some queued memory access to complete.

\subsubsection{Cache Coherency}
\label{sec:advsync:Cache Coherency}

Although cache-coherence protocols guarantee that a given CPU sees its
own accesses in order, and that all CPUs agree on the order of modifications
to a single variable contained within a single cache line, there is no
guarantee that modifications to different variables will be seen in
the same order by all CPUs --- although some computer systems do make
some such guarantees, portable software cannot rely on them.

\end{figure*}

To see why reordering can occur, consider the two-CPU system shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:advsync:Split Caches}, in which each CPU has a split
cache.
This system has the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item	An odd-numbered cache line may be in cache A, cache C,
	in memory, or some combination of the above.
\item	An even-numbered cache line may be in cache B, cache D,
	in memory, or some combination of the above.
\item	While the CPU core is interrogating one of its caches,\footnote{
		But note that in ``superscalar'' systems, the CPU
		might well be accessing both halves of its cache at
		once, and might in fact be performing multiple concurrent
		accesses to each of the halves.}
	its other cache is not necessarily quiescent.
	This other cache may instead be responding to an invalidation
	request, writing back a dirty cache line,
	processing elements in the CPU's memory-access queue, and
	so on.
\item	Each cache has queues of operations that need to be applied
	to that cache in order to maintain the required coherence
	and ordering properties.
\item	These queues are not necessarily flushed by loads from or
	stores to cache lines affected by entries in those queues.
\end{enumerate}

In short, if cache A is busy, but cache B is idle, then CPU~1's
stores to odd-numbered cache lines may be delayed compared to
CPU~2's stores to even-numbered cache lines.
In not-so-extreme cases, CPU~2 may see CPU~1's operations out
of order.

\subsection{Where Are Memory Barriers Needed?}
\label{sec:advsync:Where Are Memory Barriers Needed?}

Memory barriers are only required where there's a possibility of interaction
between two CPUs or between a CPU and a device.  If it can be guaranteed that
there won't be any such interaction in any particular piece of code, then
memory barriers are unnecessary in that piece of code.

Note that these are the \emph{minimum} guarantees.
Different architectures may give
more substantial guarantees,
\IfInBook{as discussed in Appendix~\ref{chp:app:whymb:Why Memory Barriers?},}{}
but they may \emph{not}
be relied upon outside of code specifically designed to run only on
the corresponding architecture.

However, primitives that implement atomic operations, such as locking
primitives and atomic data-structure manipulation and traversal primitives,
will normally include any needed memory barriers in their definitions.
However, there are some exceptions, such as \co{atomic_inc()} in the
Linux kernel, so be sure to review the documentation, and, if possible,
the actual implementations, for your software environment.

One final word of advice: use of raw memory-barrier primitives should
be a last resort.
It is almost always better to use an existing primitive that takes
care of memory barriers.
